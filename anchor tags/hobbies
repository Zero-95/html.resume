    I am what you can call a jack of all trades. I have several hobbies across all sorts
    of different regions of style.

    <li>Golf</li>
<br/>
    I enjoy playing golf when i have the chance to enjoy the outdoors. Although I'm not as skilled
in the game as i would like to be, a nice walk down a beautiful landscape playing my favorite 
sport in the world is nearly an essence of meditation to my soul.

    <li>Drifting</li>
    A lot of people don't quite know what this motorsport is exactly. To drift is simply a track car
that is built to slide around the track with style. If you can imagine race cars as the 
long track runners, drifting is like the dancers of the race car world. A majestic and unique
style to the car community that i enjoy every second to be apart of.

    <li>Gaming</li>
    This hobbie sits the deepest within my heart. Ever since i was a little kid i spent every second 
i could get playing any and all types of games. The ideas and imagination creators have portayed 
into these projects can be breathe taking and full of emotion. The wide span of gaming collections 
allows players to obtain a desired gameplay like an art major in an art museum. A selection of never ending
options at the grasp of every gamers reach. I dream to one day succeed in my coding adventure to have the honor
to create my own game and share it among the world of players.
